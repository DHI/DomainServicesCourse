## How to Get Started

To set up the sample application to run on you own machine you have to configure and run the following four services:

### Authorization Server

The Authorization Server (`AuthorizationServer.sln`) uses a pair of RSA signing keys for generation and validation of JWT access tokens. You need to generate and store these RSA keys as environment variables as described in the [documentation](https://dhi-developer-documentation.azurewebsites.net/domain_services/faq/#how-to-create-a-pair-of-rsa-signing-keys-for-generation-and-validation-of-jwt-access-tokens).

> NOTE: It requires a restart to enable new environment variables.

To build and run the Authorization Server, use the `BuildAndRun.bat` file. 

## Web Server

The web API is configured with a PostgreSQL database. You have to create an environment variable called "PostgreSqlConnectionString" with the connection string.

> NOTE: It requires a restart to enable new environment variables.

To build and run the Web Server (`WebApi.sln`), use the `BuildAndRun.bat` file.

## Job Orchestrator

To install the Job Orchestrator (`JobOrchestratorWinService.sln`) as a Windows Service run `install.bat`

> NOTE: Remember to force administrator privileges.

Once installed, the Job Orchestrator is managed (start/stop) through the standard Services application:

The Job Orchestrator is configured to log to the Event Viewer:

## Job Host

Your own machine will be acting as the job host. 

Build and run the DeployWorkflowService (`workflow.sln`). This will create a "Deployment" folder (in the debug or release folder).

From here you must run `DHI.Workflow.Service.WinSvcHost.Install.bat` 

> NOTE: Remember to force administrator privileges.

Once installed, the workflow service is managed (start/stop) through the standard Services application (see above).
